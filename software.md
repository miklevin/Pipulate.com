### Installing Linux & Pipulate

To install Pipulate, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miklevin/drinkme/main/install.bat">Drink Me</a>.

### Using JupyterLab

After the Drink Me script is finished running, Linux and Pipulate will both be
installed on your Windows system and JupyterLab will soon be reachable in a Web
browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>. You will however
have to open a Linux Terminal to "wake up" Jupyter. This is due to a limitation
in WSL and I expect this requirement to change soon. Windows Terminal may have
installed with Linux, but in case it didn't, grab it from the Microsoft Store.

Once you have JupyterLab displaying in your Web browser, you're in business.
Simply copy/paste any of the code in these examples into a new Notebook or go
into the repo named pipulate and run the code from the example files found
there. Those examples will match what you find here.

### Persistent Dict as Database

Before doing anything else, you need to understand how to make the Python
***dictionary*** datatype, or simply ***dict***, persistent. With a persistent
dict, many requirements for a database in your day-to-day work seems to go
away. A persistent dict really is a database, but you hardly have to think
about it that way.

```python
from sqlitedict import SqliteDict as sqldict

with sqldict("name.db") as db:
    db["some key"] = "Some Value"
    db.commit()
```

Now even after you've powered down your computer and come back later, you can
reverse the process and get back the values you set:

```python
from sqlitedict import SqliteDict as sqldict

with sqldict("name.db") as db:
    for key in db:
    data = db[key]
    print(data)
```

This is a million-dollar trick that gives you a lightweight NoSQL database for
every occasion. Use it as a real database. Use it as a cache. It's fast and run
by the instance of SQLite3 that comes built into Python.

You're welcome.

### Grabbing Data Quick & Easy

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://www.worldometers.info/geography/alphabetical-list-of-countries/'
df = pd.read_html(url)[0]
df.to_csv("countries.csv", index=False)
```

That will drop a comma separated value file (CSV) on your drive in the same
location as where you created the Jupyter Notebook. The file will contain a
list of countries with populations, land area and density from the table that
was displaying on that URL. This trick doesn't always work, but when it does,
it's glorious. The process can be reversed as follows, and is another way to
get database-like functionality without all the fuss.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
```

You're welcome.
